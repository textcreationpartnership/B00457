            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Hence it cometh that miſerable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do fall ſo fast headlong into hell fire: &amp; truly, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, <hi>If the iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall ſcarce be ſaued,</hi>

            <p>Notwithſtanding although that death be not good, yet hath the wiſdome of God ſo found out a meanes as it were to temper or ſeaſon the ſame, as that out of this bitter root much ſweet ſruit may growe.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.</note> and the Church in the preface of the Maſſe of the Reſurrection ſpeaking of Christ ſayth, <hi>Who by dying deſtroyed our death, &amp; by riſing agayne repayred our life:</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that death which destroyed ours, &amp; repayred our life cannot be otherwiſe then very good, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Finally the ſame is confirmed by reaſon which doth shew death howſoeuer in it ſelfe ill, by the grace of God, to worke and procure much good: for first we reape great good by death in that it riddeth vs from all the miſeryes of this life, which are both very many,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>By theſe teſtimonyes of ſacred VVrit is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proued death to haue this good annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, that it deliuers a man from infinit miſeryes of this life. Moreouer it yieldeth vs another farre more eminent good then this, becauſe it is the gate by which we enter and paſſe from a priſon to a Kingdome. This was reuealed by our Lord to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle and Euangeliſt, whiles for the fayth of Chriſt he liued in banishment in the Ile of <hi>Pathmos:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>I heard</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>a voyce from heauen ſaying vnto me: Bleſſed are the dead who dye in our Lord; from hence foorth now ſayth the ſpirit they may reſt from their labours, for their workes doe follow them.</hi> Bleſſed truly is the death of Saints which at the commaund of the heauenly King deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the ſoule from the priſon of the flesh &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it to the Kingdome of heauen, where the holy ſoules now free from all labours doe ſweetly repoſe, and for reward of their works do receaue the crown of a Kingdome: and euen vnto the ſoules which are caryed to Purgatory death yieldeth a great benefit, whiles it deliuereth them from the feare and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hell, and makes them ſecure of their future &amp; euerlaſting felicity: yea, euen vnto the damned death ſeemeth to yield ſome good, when deliuering
<pb facs="tcp:181065:12"/> them the ſooner from their bodyes, it maketh that the meaſure of their torments shal no more increaſe by the ſynnes they would haue committed in their longer life.</p>
            <p>For theſe ſo notable vtilityes death sheweth not a dreadfull but a ſmiling, not a terrible but an amiable countenance towards the good: &amp; hence it proceeded that the Apoſtle ſo ſecurely cryed out, <hi>Chriſt is my life and death my gayne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt: &amp; in his firſt Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the good Chriſtians not to be contriſtated with the deaths of their deereſt friends, neyther to bemoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them as dead, but rather to behold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> resting as it were in a ſleepe.</p>
            <p>And there liued not long ſince a holy woman called <hi>Catharine Adorna</hi> of the Citty of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua,</hi> who was ſo enflamed with the loue of Chriſt, that shee had an incredible deſire to dye and go to her beloued Sauiour, &amp; for this cauſe tranſported with the loue of death shee did often prayſe the ſam as moſt fayre and beautifull, only miſliking that she fled from ſuch as ſought her, and ſought for ſuch as fled from her. The Reader may ſee more hereof in the <hi>7.</hi> Chapter of her life. Out of theſe things which we haue ſayd we ſee that death as it is the childe of ſin is euill but through the grace &amp; mercy of Chriſt who vouchſafed to dy for vs, to become many wayes profitable and wholſome, amiable and delightfull.</p>

               <p>But before both theſe, this generall rule is to be premiſed, to wit that he liu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> well, that deſires to dye well: for ſince that death is the end of our life, certainly euery one who liueth vertuouſly vntil the end, doth dye well: and he cannot dye ill, who neuer liued ill. As on the other ſide, he who hath alwayes liued ill doth ſo dye; and he cannot but dye ill who neuer liued well; and ſo it fareth in all other like things. For euery one who keepeth on the right way to the place where he goeth, arryueth without any miſſing or going out of the way: but he who miſtaketh the right way ſhal neuer come to the end he would; he who ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyeth diligently to attayne learning, wil ſoone become learned, &amp; doctor alſo in that he profeſſeth; and he who goeth alwayes to ſchoole, but applyeth not his mynd vnto learning, doth but le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some perhaps will alleadge the example of the good theefe, who alwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes liued ill, and dyed well, and made a happy end. But it is not ſo: For that good theefe rather liued deuoutly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, and therfore dyed alſo ſo ſaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For notwithſtanding that he ſpent the greateſt part of his life wickedly, yet he ſo well beſtowed the other, as he eaſily blotted out all former offences, &amp; attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto great &amp; ſingular merits. For en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with charity towards God, he openly defended Chriſt from the flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Iewes; and hauing the like loue towards his neighbour he warned and checked his blaſpheming compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and endeauored all he could to recall him to a better life; for as yet he was in this mortall life when he ſaid vnto his fellow, <hi>neque tu times Deum qui in eadem dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione es?

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the ſecond precept of dying well, which is to dye first to the world.</head>
               <p>NOw then to proceed that a man do liue well aboue all things, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he dye to the world, before he dye to this corporall life. For all ſuch as liue to the world, are dead to God; and it is impoſſible that any can begin to liue to God vnles he firſt dye vnto the world. This verity is ſo euidently deliuered in the holy ſcriptures, as it cannot be called into queſtion but by Infidells and misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers: and that in the mouth of 2. or 3. witneſſes euery word may ſtand, I will alleadge the holy Apoſtles, <hi>S.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:181065:20"/> being poore in ſpirit, dead to the world, and liuing, only to God, they had moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xactly learned this art how to dye well. And therefore not abundance of wealth, or ſublimity of honour, or Kingdome, or Empire make a man to be of the world, or that he liue in the world, <hi>but concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the flesh, concupiſcence of the eyes, and pride of life,</hi> which in one word is called <hi>Cupidity,</hi> or diſordinate affection, &amp; is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Theologicall vertue of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; &amp; therefore if any through the grace and mercy of God begin to loue God for himſelfe, and for his ſake his neighbour, he beginneth to go out of the world; and this Charity increaſing, the other diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly appetite will go leſſe and leſſe, and ſo he will begin to dye to the world: for charity cannot increaſe without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the other: &amp; by this meanes it will come to paſſe alſo that, that thing which whiles thoſe other paſſions were predominant ſeemed impoſſible, to wit, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing in the world ſhould not be of the world, through this increaſe of the loue of God, &amp; decreaſe of diſordinat affections, will become moſt eaſy; for that which to this cupidity is a hard and

               <p>That then which before we ſaid, to wit, that to go out of the world, and to dye to the world, is not the play of boyes, or paſtime of babes, but a moſt weighty and difficult thing, &amp; moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of ſuch as haue not knowne the power of the grace of God, nor taſted the ſweetnes of his charity, and of ſuch as are ſenſuall without ſpirit: for he who hath once taſted of the ſpirit of God, doth loath whatſoeuer fleſh &amp; bloud do ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt: therefore euery one who earneſtly deſireth to learne this art of dying well, vpon which his euerlaſting weale, and all true happines doth depend, let him protract no tyme, but preſently go out of the world, &amp; perfectly dye to the world; when as otherwiſe it cannot poſſibly be, that a man can liue to the world &amp; God togeather, and at once enioy both earth and heauen.</p>

Now is to be added what he is to doe, who is dead to the world that he may liue to God, becauſe it is graunted to none to dye well, that haue not liued well in this life, as I haue written in the firſt chapter. The briefe ſumme of liuing well is expreſſed by the Apoſtle in his firſt to <hi>Timothy</hi> in theſe wordes: <hi>Finis praecepti caritas de corde puro &amp; conſcientia bona, &amp; fide non ficta:</hi> the end of the commaundement is charity from a pure hart, and a good conſcience,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> and an vnfeyned faith: the Apoſtle was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the anſwere which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did giue to him who demaunded, <hi>quid faciendo vitam aeternam poſſidebo?</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:181065:22"/> but he would explicate in few words the end of the principal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, on which the whole law and the vnderſtanding &amp; fulfilling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the way to euerlaſting life doth depend; and withall he would teach vs what vertues, are neceſſary to perfection, of which elſwhere he ſaid, <hi>nunc manent fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ſpes, caritas, maior autem est caritas:</hi> now there remayne fayth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> hope, and charity but the greater of thoſe is charity, he ſaith therefore <hi>that charity is the end of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This later part which might ſeeme more obſcure he declareth in his epiſtle to the Romans, ſaying, <hi>Qui diligit proximu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Let vs begin with Faith, which firſt of all before the other is in the hart of him who is to be iuſtifyed. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe did the holy Apoſtle add vnto faith this condition <hi>non ficta,</hi> not faigned, for faith beginneth our iuſtification if it be true and ſincere, not if it be falſe and feigned; the faith of heretikes beginneth not iuſtification, becauſe it is not true but falſe: the faith of ill Catholikes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the ſeauenth precept of the Art of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, which is of Prayer.</head>
               <p>OVT of that which hitherto hath beene ſayd, we haue drawne the precepts of dying well fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the three theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall vertues Faith, hope and charity, and alſo from three morall, Sobriety, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and piety, of all which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath admoniſhed vs: now I will further adioyne another precept of three other workes of vertue, of prayer, faſting and almes, which we haue learned of the Angell <hi>Raphael,</hi> for we read in the booke of <hi>Toby,</hi> the Angell to haue ſpoken in this manner: <hi>Prayer is good with faſting &amp; almes, and better then to heape vp treaſures of gold.</hi> And this threefold nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of theſe works is the frute of three vertues, of <hi>Religion, of mercy, of temperance,</hi> which haue great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with <hi>piety, iuſtice,</hi> and <hi>ſobriety</hi> before mentioned: for as <hi>piety</hi> concerneth

Of Prayer many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours haue written many things, we for our preſent purpoſe will explicate three only; one of the neceſſity of prayer, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the vtilityes, and the third of the manner how we may fruitfully make it.</p>

               <p>Beſides theſe three principall fruites, there are very many other: for firſt prayer doth illuminate or lighten our mynd; for it cannot otherwiſe be, but that he who fixeth faſt the eyes of his mynd on God who is all light, but that he be lightened, <hi>accedite ad eum</hi> (ſayth Dauid) <hi>&amp; illuminamini:</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE two Sacraments that enſue now briefly to be conſidered do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyne vnto all Chriſtians, but one to Clergy men to wit <hi>Order,</hi> the other to lay men to wit <hi>matrimony:</hi> let vs ſpeake a little of the firſt, I meane not all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this Sacrament, but thoſe things only which are neceſſary to this art of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing &amp; dying well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orders</hi> in number are ſeauen, fower leſſer, and three greater: of which the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt which is Prieſthood is deuided into two, for there are greater Prieſts which are called Biſhops, and leſſer which are ſingle prieſts; before all theſe Orders is giuen <hi>prima tonſura,</hi> which is it were a gate vnto all the Orders, and properly maketh them clarks or Clergy men; and for that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:181065:79"/> the things which are required of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Clarks, eſpecially what concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vertuous &amp; religious life, by greater reaſon are to be exacted of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue taken the leſſer or greater Orders, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of Prieſts and Biſhops: therefore I will reſtraine my ſpeach to conſider and explicate thoſe things only which do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to theſe inferiour Clarkes.</p>
               <p>Two thinges there be in theſe Clarks that require explication. Firſt the rite or manner of their ordering, then the office which they are to exerciſe in the Church. The rite or manner of their ordering, as appeareth by the Pontificall is this, that firſt of all ſome <hi>little part of their haires be clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of,</hi> by which ceremony is ſignifyed the caſting off of all ſuperfluous thoughts and deſires, as are the thoughts and deſires of temporall things, riches, honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and the like: and that they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whiles the Biſhop cutteth away their hayers to ſay that verſe of the 15. pſalme, <hi>Our Lord is the portion of myne inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of my cuppe: thou</hi> (O Lord) <hi>shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me againe myne inheritance;</hi> Then doth the Biſhop call for a ſurpliſe and cauſeth the new Clarke to put it on, ſaying that of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:181065:80"/> the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians: God veſt thee with the new man, which is created according to God in iuſtice and holines of truth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</note> but there is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice aſſigned to this new Clarke, but out of the ancient cuſtome, we gather his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be to ſerue the prieſt when he ſayth Maſſe in, eaſe he ſay it priuately.</p>
               <p>Now let vs contemplate what height of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is required in a clark, and if ſo much be required in a Clarke, what is required in an Acolite, in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, in a Deacon, in a Prieſt, in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Truly I find in my ſelfe a horrour of mynd to thinke theron, when as there are ſcant found theſe thinges in many prieſts which by vertue of the ordering is required in a ſimple Clarke. The Clarke is willed to caſt away ſuperfluous thoughts and deſires which are proper vnto ſecular men, that is to ſay men which apperteyne vnto this world, who are of the world &amp; who do alwayes thinke and deſire the goods of the world: a good Clarke is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to ſeeke no other part or porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or inheritance but God, that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone be his riches and inheritance, &amp; that he may truly be ſayd and found to be the part and inhertance of God. O height of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:181065:80"/> Clericall perfection, which forſakes the whole world that it may poſſeſſe God, &amp; may agayne by reciprocall loue be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of God alone.</p>
               <p>This is the meaning of the words of the pſalme, Our Lord is the part of my inheritance and of my cuppe, <hi>pars haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the part of my inheritance. This part is called that portion which out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of an inheri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> amongſt many brothers, doth befall to ech one a part, the ſenſe then of the wordes is not that a Clergy man ſhould make God one part of his inheritance, and earthly riches an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but that from his hart he deſire that God be all his part, portion, or inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: that is al that he may expect in this world, and that whatſoeuer here he may haue, out of a religious affection he may make it all ouer vnto God. Betwene the <hi>cuppe</hi> and the <hi>inheritance</hi> there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the <hi>cuppe</hi> belongeth vnto plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delights, the <hi>inheritance</hi> vnto we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth and honours. Wherefore the full and entiere ſenſe of the verſe is: O my Lord God, from hence forward whatſoeuer I might hope for in this world of riches, of delights, of temporall commodityes, all
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:181065:81"/> that whatſoeuer it be I doe deſire to haue in thee alone, thou alone doeſt abundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly ſuffiſe for all other things, and for that the plenty of heauenly riches is not to be found on earth, therefore doth this Clark go on in his prayer, &amp; ſaith <hi>tu es qui reſtitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But leaſt that any ſhould cal in doubt our explication, I will confirme it by two witneſſes not liable to reproofe, to wit Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Nepotianus</hi> of the life of Clergy men ſayth: <q rend="margQuotes">Therefore let the Clergy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſerueth Gods Church expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his own name, &amp; hauing defined it, let him endeauour to be that which he is called, for if <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>My ſelfe can be a witneſſe of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty which ſuch for the moſt part doe fynd: for when at a tyme I viſited a frend, a rich Gentleman, (who by reaſon of a great ſynne he had committed, fell into a deadly diſeaſe) &amp; told him, that there was nothing better for him to ſeeke for, as thinges then ſtood, then true repentance and contrition for his ſynne, becauſe that God neuer deſpiſeth a contrite and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled hart: he anſwered me with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: <hi>VVhat is Contrition?

               <p>But aboue all Contrition is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for one that will diſpoſe himſelfe to dye well, for confeſſion without contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or true attrition is not ſufficient for ſaluation, and without contrition ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is inualid, or of no force, which

Truly I am of opinion that they were only <hi>veniall,</hi> that ſo he might not only be deliuered from hell fire, but from Purgatory alſo, and ſo preſently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into heauen.

               <p>Two reaſons may be giuen why in our dayes ſo few ſicke men do recouer their ſickenes, notwithſtanding that they receaue this Sacrament: one is, for that now a dayes this remedy is applyed to the ſicke later then it ſhould, for we muſt not expect miracles by this or any other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and it were a miracle if one that is at the laſt gaſpe ſhould preſently reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but if this Sacrament were miniſtred vnto then when firſt of all they beginne to be daungerouſly ſicke, we ſhould then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee this effect of recouery, which wold not be done in a moment, but would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in tyme: and this is the cauſe why that ſuch as are to be executed by way of iuſtice are not anneyled, becauſe that they

                  </gap> diſeaſe, but rather it is better for him to dy, and the prayer of the Church which is made in this Vnction doth not abſolutely deſire the health of the ſicke party but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recouer his health at that tyme, if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be auayleable for his ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Another effect of this Sacrament is <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> for thus ſpeaketh Saint <hi>Iames: Et ſi in peccatis fuerit remittentur ei:</hi> and if he ſhall be in ſynnes they ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen remember them, and therefore the ſicke man ſought not for a prieſt to whom he might confeſſe them. Theſe reliks doth the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Extreme Vnction</hi> take away, and of this kynde of ſynnes Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth: <hi>If he shall be in ſinnes they thall be remitted him;</hi> which the Councels of <hi>Florence</hi> &amp; <hi>Trent</hi> doe teach, eſpecially the latter in the 14. ſeſſion &amp; ſecond Canon.</p>
               <p>Another kind of the relikes of ſyns is a certayne horrour or ſtupidity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrow and heauines which oppreſſe ſicke, to which apperteyneth the promiſe of Saint <hi>Iames: Et alleuiabit eum Dominus,</hi> and our Lord will lift him vp: this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t recomforteth the ſicke, when they marke the diuine promiſes expreſſed in the ſame, and for that cauſe it ſhould not be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill the laſt houre when the ſicke man doth not heare, or elſe vnderſtandeth nothing at all.</p>
               <p>What vtility is reaped out of this Sacrament may be gathered by the words of the forme thereof. Fiue places there be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:181065:140"/> which are ſpecially annoynted, in which the fiue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes are ſcituated: to wit the ſenſe of ſeeing, the ſenſe of hearing, the ſenſe of ſmelling, the ſenſe of taſting, and the ſenſe of touching: and in the meane tyme the prieſt ſayth: <hi>Indulgeat tibi Dominus quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid deliquiſti per viſum, auditum &amp;c.</hi> Our Lord pardon or forgiue thee in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou haſt ſynned by ſight, by hearing, and ſo of the reſt: and becauſe that prayer is the forme of the Sacrament without all controuerſy it effectually worketh that which the words doe ſound and ſignify, vnleſſe there be ſome impediment on the behalfe of the receauer.</p>
               <p>How great the bountifulneſſe and mercy of our Lord God is in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he will ſoone fynde that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelfe what a mayne multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſynnes do flow from theſe fiue fountaynes: and this was the occaſion why Saint <hi>Malachy</hi> a Biſhop of Ireland, whoſe life Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> wrote, after that for ſome houres he had delayed to miniſter this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Extreme Vnction to a certeyne noble woman that was ſicke, and ſhe the meane tyme had departed out of this life, he ſo farre foorth repented himſelfe that

               <p>The firſt ſhall be of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid.
